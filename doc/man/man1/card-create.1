\f[B]virgil card\-create\f[] {\[en]public\-key \f[I]file\f[]|\-e
\f[I]arg\f[]} {\-d \f[I]arg\f[]|\-f \f[I]file\f[]} [\-o \f[I]file\f[]]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Virgil Card is a base of building the net of trust between users.
There are two types of Cards: 1.
with a confirmed identity.
\f[I]validated_identity\f[] is required, it can be obtained in
\f[C]identity\-confirm(1)\f[] (../markdown/identity-confirm.1.md) 2.
with an unconfirmed identity.
.PP
A Card with a confirmed Identity guarantees that a user with given email
has been checked.
.PP
A Card with an unconfirmed Identity lets use Public Keys Service
infrastructure while staying anonymous.
There is \f[I]no way\f[] to turn a Card with an unconfirmed Identity
into a Card with a confirmed Identity!
.PP
Connections between Cards can be created.
Model many\-to\-many is implemented in PKI.
It means that we can have Cards with:
